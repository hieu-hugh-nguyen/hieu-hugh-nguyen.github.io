  Welcome! I'm a research scientist and engineer in Machine Learning, Digital Health, and Predictive Analytics.
  
  <br><br>
  I'm getting my PhD Degree in Biomedical Engineering, Data Science track at JHU 
  (#1 BME Program in the U.S., #10 National University by US News)
  , working in the intersection of machine learning/AI, statistics, and medicine
  . I develop machine learning algorithms for better, more suitable, and more accurate analysis of big biomedical data. 
  I'm also involved in 11 projects that employ state-of-the-art machine learning methods to answer clinical questions.
  I'm interested in the use of large, high-dimensional medical data in predicting disease onset
  , forecasting disease trajectory, personalizing therapy, and discovering novel biomarkers.

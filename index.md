### Projects 

[A Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Cardiac Arrest Outcome Using a Large Multi-Center Database](/sample_page)

Utilizing electronic health record and bed-side monitoring temporal data, our post-cardiac arrest neurologic outcome and mortality prediction machine learning model outperforms the baseline APACHE model by area under the receiver operating curve of 12% and 15% respectively, showing both the efficacy of integrating time series data and the generalizability of utilizing a diverse multicenter database.
